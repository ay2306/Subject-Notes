**Answer:** An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware and controls the execution of all kinds of programs.

**Question 2:** What are important functions of an operating system?

**Answer:** 
- Memory Management (File System)
- Process Management (Scheduling)
- Device Management (Drivers)
- Security (Password access and restricted access)
- Error Detection (Handling Deadlocks)

**Question 3:** Explain different types of operating systems.

**Answer:** 
1. Batch operating system
    - User prepares jobs offline and run it in system at one go
    - Lack of interaction between the user and the job.

**Question 4:** What is multithreading?

**Answer:** Multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system.

**Question 5:** Disadvantages of Multithreading.

**Answer:** 
1. Can lead to deadlock
2. Difficult to debug
 
**Question 6:** Process vs Thread.

**Answer:**
- A process have its own code, data, heap and stack. Stack is required to manage function calls. Each thread has its own stack. 
- All threads in a process share code, data and heap of the process.
- Multiple threads can be running simultaneously on multiprocessor system.
- Threads in a same process share same address space.
